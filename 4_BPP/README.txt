Files used in BPP to validate the population assignments that resulted from GENELAND and BAPS.
ctl files corresponds to different combinations of prior distributions of ancestral population size (theta) and root age (tau):
1- small ancestral population size and shallow divergence time
2- large ancestral population size and deep divergence time
3- small ancestral population size and deep divergence time
4- large ancestral population size and shallow divergence time
