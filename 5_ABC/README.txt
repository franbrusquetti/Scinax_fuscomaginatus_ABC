Scripts for simulations used for ABC model selection and to perform Goodness-of-fit (gfit) and Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) analyses
0_simulations_ABC_preliminary.R: used to determine appropriate prior intervals for effective population size (Ne), theta mitochondrial and theta nuclear
1_simulations_ABC_final.R: used to generate final simulations and model selection
2_gfit_ppc.R: used to validate selected model
