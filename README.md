#Files used to generate the analyses presented in "Model-based analyses suggest Pleistocene refugia over ancient divergence as main diversification driver for a Neotropical open-habitat treefrog"

1_BAPS
Files with genetic dataset and coordinates used in BAPS to estimate number of populations and individual assignment coefficients for all Scinax fuscomarginatus samples.
2_GENELAND
Files with genetic dataset and coordinates used in GENELAND to estimate number of populations and individual assignment coefficients for all Scinax fuscomarginatus samples.
3_STAR BEAST
Files with genetic datasets, and paramaters and priors (xml generated in BEAUti) used to infer a species tree with *BEAST according to BAPS and GENELAND population assignment.
4_BPP
Files used in BPP to validate the population assignments that resulted from GENELAND and BAPS.
5_ABC
Scripts for simulations used for ABC model selection and to perform Goodness-of-fit (gfit) and Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) analyses.
